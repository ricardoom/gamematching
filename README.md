# Matching Game

## v0.0.1

## A Javascript learning project.

Another project designed to help me learn Javascript. This one has been fun fun.

### Run the project

Install SASS, if it is not already present
`npm install` to grab BrowserSync
`npm run dev`

### Issues encountered and things learned...

Matching game is not as easy as I thought it would be, to my mind there are a few areas of logic that need to be handled:

- board and card generation:
  - We need the ability set/alter the amount of cards for a given game, so functionality for dynamic / explicit generation of cards is wanted
  - Creating the `html` for each card was tricky, but the `createRange` and `createContextualFragment` APIs saved the day.
  - randomizing the board was a bit tricky so I leaned on StackOverflow and found a very simple approach to randomizing items in an array. I chose not to mutate my array, mostly to avoid any issues arising in the future from a altering the original array.
  - Generating the board from the new objects created. My approach feels kludgy, but it works. I'll come back and refactor I'm sure.
- Game Play:
  - Since the cards are not buttons or links (if anything they should be buttons I think...) each card needed a click handler.
    - The animation is done w/ css
  - Logic for counting the number of clicks ie: cards turned over (2)
  - Then preventing the user to click anymore cards
  - Setting a timer to turn the card _back_ over and allowing cards to be clicked again
  - Some css was wanted to change the cursor so it was obvious the cards could be clicked on.
  - Flipping the cards over
- Sundry other issues:
  - Turns out the `svg` `x:link` attribute on a `<use>` element is deprecated. So use of a simple `href` attribute is wanted... still not working in Chrome tho ðŸ¤”...
    - Chrome wants `height` and `width` attributes, which is fine but that caused all styling to go haywire and trouble w/ the `viewBox`
  - `npm`, BrowserSync and sundry related issues were a thing for minute, but they got sorted, not fun, but seemingly necessary. I've been eschewing using `npm` modules, the primary reason being, I want to really understand what my code is doing, so importing magic seems like wrong move at this point in my learning path.

### TODOs

- Make more accessible: `aria` attribution etc...
- Create the card artwork
- Logic for creating card pairs
- Logic for matching card pairs
- Better responsive layout

### Nice to Haves

- Do some fun animated shuffling of the board w/ GSAP
- Create a UI for changing game options
  - Number of cards on the board to increase difficulty
  - Timed games
- Put up on glitch or serve up via own server

### Change Log

- v0.0.1
  - got the thing going
  - using browser sync.
  - lots of other stuff...
